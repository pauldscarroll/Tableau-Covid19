# Tableau-Covid19
## Tableau Visualisations

### John Hopkins Dataset from Kaggle. Covid19 - week4

This is a side project and an area of special interest to me. Within this repository I've posted the Jupyter notebook I used to back up the tableau work, and to respond to some of the questions, I had to webscrape population data, and merge the datasets.

I posted a linkedin article, my first, showing the majority of the visualisations. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-dataset-week4-paul-carroll/

Thank you, Paul
